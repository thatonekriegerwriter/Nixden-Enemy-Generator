Multiattack <ACC: ≥ 45, P. ATK ≤ 30 >: 
Allows you to repeatedly attack in the same 
turn, for each attack, you have to roll a new 
accuracy roll, if you miss, you stop attacking. 
If you are using Multiattack, you have to say 
that out in RP. If the other person’s dodge is 
1, they get to reroll until it is NOT a one. 
You lose 2 damage every reroll. 

Health Roulette Charm <HP ≥ 50>: 
At the beginning of a battle, you can 
optionally swap your max HP with one random 
(non-boss level) enemy’s max HP for the 
duration of the fight. If their max HP is 
higher than yours, it does NOT autoheal you up 
to full. If the enemy’s max HP is over 150, 
it won’t pick them/will be cut down to that. 

Damage-Health Charm: 
Takes 5 from your ATK stats, 
and adds 50 to your max health, it does NOT autoheal you up 
to full..
